`utilsmme` is  collection of utilities developed by and for the [Mathematical Marine Ecology Lab (MME)]("https://mathmarecol.github.io") at the University of Queensland. They are intended for use within the lab to facilitate ease of code-sharing and reducing the amount of repetitive code that must be maintained. The authors of this package compiled the functions and maintain the package, but the author of the individual functions are indicated in the function help. 

Some functions in this package will work for all users, but many will require access to lab datasets.

You can install the development version of `utils4mme` with:

``` r
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/MathMarEcol/utils4mme")
